## Brief Overview:
This notebook introduces K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors. It also covers data normalization, a preprocessing technique used to scale features to a common range, which is essential for distance-based algorithms like KNN.

Beside this, The project itself is very much self-explanatory.
