The main goal of this project is to implement kNN regression algorithm and evaluate its performance using cross validation.

This is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for regression tasks. It is a non-parametric (no assumption about the underlying distribution of the data) algorithm that is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of independent variables.


METRICS USED FOR CROSS VALIDATION:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.



CROSS VALIDATION:
Cross-validation is a technique that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is a technique that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.
